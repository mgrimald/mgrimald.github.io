#00 : basic


This project is an attempt to learn to use React.Js (and probably several other things)

I started to learn about react with two interactive courses on codecademy.com :
  https://www.codecademy.com/fr/learn/react-101 
  https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-102
Codecademy is a really nice place to start to learn about many technologies because you directly apply and see what you are learning.
BUT its system take you a little too much by the hand, telling you what to type and where to type it.
So it's really great to have a preview but it lacks a lot of things to be enough by itself.

Therefore I started to look after some projects I could work on to really grasp this framework.
A ToDo app seemed interesting : the basis is not too complex but it can be expended in several aspects.

I found this tutorial : https://scotch.io/tutorials/create-a-simple-to-do-app-with-react
I have to confide that I am no frontDev (yet).
I can't write CSS, I can't write well structured HTML aaaand I barely know JS.
Of course I can read it without difficulties, but as my cursus made me work mostly on C and C++, I am not used to the JS way of doing things
The tutorial really helped me to understand the way to structure components, html and what to put where.
But at the same time, there were several pieces of codes I really didn't like.

Eventually I coded this simple app :
	- A TodoApp, coordinating all the elements. This component store and handle the data;
	- A TodoForm, who can ADD a new entry to the data of TodoApp;
	- A TodoList who display each Todo;
	- A (list of) Todo with an id and a title;
	- A Title component who just display the main title.
