#00 : basic


This project is an attempt to learn to use React.Js (and probably several other things)

I started to learn about react with two interactive courses on codecademy.com :
  https://www.codecademy.com/fr/learn/react-101 
  https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-102
Codecademy is a really nice place to start to learn about many technologies because you directly apply and see what you are learning.
BUT its system take you a little too much by the hand, telling you what to type and where to type it.
So it's really great to have a preview but it lacks a lot of things to be enough by itself.

Therefore I started to look after some projects I could work on to really grasp this framework.
A ToDo app seemed interesting : the basis is not too complex but it can be expended in several aspects.

I found this tutorial : https://scotch.io/tutorials/create-a-simple-to-do-app-with-react


Eventually I coded this simple app :
	- A TodoApp, coordinating all the elements. This component store and handle the data;
	- A TodoForm, who can ADD a new entry to the data of TodoApp;
	- A TodoList who display each Todo;
	- A (list of) Todo with an id and a title;
	- A Title component who just display the main title.
