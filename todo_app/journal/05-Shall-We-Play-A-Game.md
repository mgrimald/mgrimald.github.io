#05: Shall we play a game : 
Yesterday i switched the html/css to Semantic Ui, a rather usefull (framework for) User Interface.
Next one i will try will be ... Material UI ... I guess. But not today.


Today I am going to (re-)create a little game : Calculator the game

(a few days later : )
Well, that was the intention I had.
Eventualy, I made 
-> a first board/calculatrice but it took me way too long to figure out how to do what i wanted to do (this particular design)
-> several clocks.
-> a landing page and a header system

I spent a lot of time writing content for the landing page.

Why would i create several clocks ?
Because I found this "ebook" : https://www.fullstackreact.com/30-days-of-react/
and one of its example is a very basic clock.
So i used this basic component to create more and more around it.
I found this book because i was searching to improve my react design pattern and to be sure i knew all the basis of react before going further.

I am now around page 108 (on 296). (didn't do the input/controled/uncontroled components : I already saw that a lot in the todoApp, I will wait for another opportunity)

So, once i did that, I had to go back to clean up a little of my mess.
I didn't touch much of the existing parts unless i could group them up and reuse them (eg: the HeaderLinks component and the router components).

I will definitively need to go back to this mess later on. (well, maybe one day) But for now, I will keep it that way.

The following days are now really going to be creating a little game ... Or creating even more tests.
